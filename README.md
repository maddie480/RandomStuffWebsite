# Maddie's Random Stuff Website
This is the source code for the [maddie480.ovh](https://maddie480.ovh/) website, an app running on Java 17 using [Eclipse Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/).

The `src` folder contains the source for everything provided by the Java servlet:
- [the Everest Update Checker frontend service](https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/everest_update.yaml), exposing files produced by the Update Checker
- [the Celeste custom entity catalog](https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/custom-entity-catalog), and [its API version](https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/custom-entity-catalog.json)
- [the everest.yaml validator](https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/everest-yaml-validator)
- [an online version of Olympus News](https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/olympus-news)
- [the Everest Update Checker status page](https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/update-checker-status)
- [the Celeste font generator](https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/font-generator)
- [the Celeste Mod Structure Verifier](https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/mod-structure-verifier)
- [the #celeste_news_network subscription service](https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/news-network-subscription) - the Mastodon update checking code is not part of the frontend and can be found [on the Random Backend Stuff repository](https://github.com/maddie480/RandomBackendStuff/blob/main/src/main/java/ovh/maddie480/randomstuff/backend/celeste/crontabs/MastodonUpdateChecker.java)
- [the help page for the Mod Structure Verifier bot](https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/mod-structure-verifier-help?collabName=CollabName&collabMapName=CollabMapName&assets&xmls&nomap&multiplemaps&badmappath&badenglish&misplacedyaml&noyaml&yamlinvalid&multiyaml&missingassets&missingentities&missingfonts)
- [the "Show Arbitrary Mods on Profile" GameBanana app](https://gamebanana.com/apps/752)
- [the Discord Games Bot](https://maddie480.ovh/discord-bots#games-bot) - the "bot" is actually a webhook that gets called by Discord
- [the Discord Custom Slash Commands app](https://maddie480.ovh/discord-bots#custom-slash-commands)
- [the Discord Timezone Bot](https://maddie480.ovh/discord-bots#timzeone-bot) - this repository only includes the "without timezone roles" variant; the one with timezone roles needs a bot user to work, and as such is [part of the backend](https://github.com/maddie480/RandomBackendStuff/tree/main/src/main/java/ovh/maddie480/randomstuff/backend/discord/timezonebot)
- Some [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com)-related APIs extending the official API, described below
- [the BananaBot app for Discord](https://maddie480.ovh/discord-bots#bananabot) - allows searching for Celeste mods on GameBanana, using the same search as Olympus and the Banana Mirror Browser
- the [Everest](https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/everest-versions) and [Olympus](https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/olympus-versions) versions list APIs
- ... and some other things of more limited use that are on the website.

The `front-vue` folder contains the source for more dynamic frontend parts made in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/):
- [the Banana Mirror Browser](https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/banana-mirror-browser), a website that can substitute to [the GameBanana Celeste section](https://gamebanana.com/games/6460) if it is down. Files and images are [hosted on 0x0ade's server](https://celestemodupdater.0x0a.de/). Mod info and files on this server are kept up-to-date by [the Everest update checker](https://github.com/maddie480/EverestUpdateCheckerServer).
- [the Celeste Map Tree Viewer](https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/map-tree-viewer), a tool allowing you to see the raw contents of your map .bin as a tree, in order to find out what it is or search for a specific entity, trigger, decal or styleground.
- [the Celeste Wipe Converter](https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/wipe-converter), a service to turn custom Celeste screen wipes into a format the game can use (with the [Maddie's Helping Hand](https://github.com/maddie480/MaddieHelpingHand) mod).
- [the Celeste File Searcher](https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/file-searcher), a tool to find in which Celeste mod(s) a file is on GameBanana, based on its path in the zip.

If you want to check how the update checker's everest_update.yaml file is generated, check [the Everest Update Checker Server repo](https://github.com/maddie480/EverestUpdateCheckerServer) instead.

## GameBanana search API

This API uses the mod search database generated by [the Everest Update Checker server](https://github.com/maddie480/EverestUpdateCheckerServer) to find mods based on keywords. **This searches Celeste mods only**.

It is used by [Olympus](https://github.com/EverestAPI/Olympus), the Everest installer and mod manager, to search Celeste mods on GameBanana.

To use this API, call `https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/gamebanana-search?q=[search]`. The answer is in JSON format, and is a list of the top 20 matches. For example:

```
$ curl "https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/gamebanana-search?q=spring+collab+2020&full=true"
```
```json

## GameBanana sorted list API

This API allows to get a sorted list of most downloaded, liked or viewed Celeste mods on GameBanana.

If you want to retrieve the latest mod with no type filter, it is recommended to use [the real GameBanana API](https://api.gamebanana.com/docs/endpoints/Core/List/New) instead, for more up-to-date information.

The URL is `https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/gamebanana-list?sort=[sort]&type=[type]&category=[category]&page=[page]` where:
- `sort` is the info to sort on (**mandatory**). It can be `latest`, `likes`, `views` or `downloads`
- `type` (or `itemtype`) is the GameBanana type to filter on (optional and case-insensitive). For example `Map`, `Gamefile` or `Tool`
- `category` is the GameBanana mod category ID to filter on (optional), this is returned by [the GameBanana categories list API](#gamebanana-categories-list-api). For example `944`
- `page` is the page to get, first page being 1 (optional, default is 1). Each page contains 20 elements.

The output format is the same as the GameBanana search API, [see the previous section](#gamebanana-search-api). You also get the total amount of mods in the list, as a `X-Total-Count` header.

## GameBanana featured mods list API

Hit the following URL: `https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/gamebanana-featured` to get a list of all mods that are shown in the front page of Celeste.

The output is JSON, in the same as the GameBanana search API ([see the corresponding section](#gamebanana-search-api)).

Each mod has a `Featured` key if it is featured. The `Category` is one of the following:
- `today`: Best of today
- `week`: Best of this week
- `month`: Best of this month
- `3month`: Best of 3 months
- `6month`: Best of 6 months
- `year`: Best of this year
- `alltime`: Best of all time

This API sorts the mods in the same order as they are on the website: by `Category` (following the order above) then by `Position`.

## GameBanana mod info API

This API provides info on a mod, based on its `itemtype` and `itemid`, in the same as the GameBanana search API ([see the corresponding section](#gamebanana-search-api)).

The URL is `https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/gamebanana-info?itemtype=[itemtype]&itemid=[itemid]`:
```
$ curl "https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/gamebanana-info?itemtype=Mod&itemid=150813"

## GameBanana categories list API

This API allows getting a list of GameBanana item types _that have at least one Celeste mod in it_ (contrary to [the official GameBanana v2 API for this](https://api.gamebanana.com/Core/Item/Data/AllowedItemTypes?&help)), along with how many mods there are for each category.

The counts returned by this API might not match the numbers displayed on the GameBanana website; that's because GameBanana counts mods that do not show up in the list.

Each entry can have an `itemtype` and a `categoryid`, that can be used as `type` and `category` parameters on the [list API](#gamebanana-sorted-list-api).

The URL is `https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/gamebanana-categories` and the result looks like:
```yaml
- formatted: All
  count: 1406
- itemtype: Mod
  categoryid: 15655
  formatted: Assets
  count: 26
- itemtype: Mod
  categoryid: 4633
  formatted: Dialog
  count: 20
- itemtype: Mod
  categoryid: 1501
  formatted: Effects
  count: 5
- itemtype: Tool
  formatted: Tools
  count: 30
...
```

## GameBanana category RSS feed API

_Note that this API works for all GameBanana categories, not only Celeste ones._

This API uses the "get mods for a category" API from GameBanana, then turns the result in an RSS format.

Usage is very similar to the "vanilla" GameBanana API, since it calls it directly behind the scenes: for example, getting the latest Celeste helpers (https://gamebanana.com/mods/cats/5081 :arrow_right: ID is 5081) is done with
```
https://gamebanana.com/apiv8/Mod/ByCategory?_csvProperties=@gbprofile&_aCategoryRowIds[]=5081&_sOrderBy=_tsDateAdded,DESC&_nPerpage=10
```

You can get them in the RSS format by just replacing the URL and carrying over all query params except `_csvProperties`:
```
https://maddie480.ovh/gamebanana/rss-feed?_aCategoryRowIds[]=5081&_sOrderBy=_tsDateAdded,DESC&_nPerpage=10
```

You can copy this URL replacing `5081` with the category of your choice to get a feed for the latest mods in this category.
To include mod updates (and not only new mods), replace `_tsDateAdded` with `_tsDateUpdated`.

If the GameBanana API returns an error (for example if you pass an invalid parameter), this API will return it as is.

## Everest versions list API

This API is available at `https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/everest-versions`, and returns all the Everest versions available, in JSON format.  For example:
```json
[
    {
        "date": "2023-07-15T20:47:39.2562228Z",
        "mainFileSize": 19034073,
        "mainDownload": "https://dev.azure.com/EverestAPI/Everest/_apis/build/builds/3371/artifacts?artifactName=main&api-version=5.0&%24format=zip",
        "olympusMetaDownload": "https://dev.azure.com/EverestAPI/Everest/_apis/build/builds/3371/artifacts?artifactName=olympus-meta&api-version=5.0&%24format=zip",
        "author": "Kalobi",
        "olympusBuildDownload": "https://dev.azure.com/EverestAPI/Everest/_apis/build/builds/3371/artifacts?artifactName=olympus-build&api-version=5.0&%24format=zip",
        "description": "Fix update notification not showing on older installs",
        "branch": "dev",
        "version": 4071,
        "isNative": false
    },
    [...]
]
```

- `version` is the Everest version number.
- `branch` is either `dev`, `beta` or `stable`. Other branches might be created to test specific features in the future.
- `isNative` indicates whether this is a .NET Core build. Native builds (using .NET Core) are currently experimental, but non-native builds (.NET Framework) will be deprecated in the future.
- `mainDownload` is the download for use by Everest to install an update.
- `mainFileSize` is the size of the `mainDownload` file, in bytes.
- `date` is the date at which the version was published, in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.
- `olympusMetaDownload` is the download that Olympus uses to get the build size.
- `olympusBuildDownload` is the download for use by Olympus to install Everest.

Two extra fields are specified for automatic builds made after a single change (commit or pull request merge):
- `author` is the author of the change (GitHub username), either the author of the commit or the creator of the pull request.
- `description` is the description of the change, either the message of the commit or the title of the pull request.

If the version of Everest/Olympus you are calling this API from supports installing native builds (.NET Core builds), you should pass the `supportsNativeBuilds=true` query parameter to include them.


## Olympus versions list API

This API is available at `https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/olympus-versions`, and returns all the Olympus versions available, in JSON format.  For example:
```json
[
    {
        "date": "2023-09-14T22:04:54.9319239Z",
        "windowsDownload": "https://dev.azure.com/EverestAPI/Olympus/_apis/build/builds/3518/artifacts?artifactName=windows.main&api-version=5.0&%24format=zip",
        "macDownload": "https://dev.azure.com/EverestAPI/Olympus/_apis/build/builds/3518/artifacts?artifactName=macos.main&api-version=5.0&%24format=zip",
        "linuxDownload": "https://dev.azure.com/EverestAPI/Olympus/_apis/build/builds/3518/artifacts?artifactName=linux.main&api-version=5.0&%24format=zip"
        "changelog": "Make sure Lonn is run with the same Love2d install as Olympus itself on Linux",
        "branch": "main",
        "version": "23.09.14.03"
    },
    [...]
]
```

- `version` is the Olympus version number.
- `branch` is either `windows-init`, `main` or `stable`. `windows-init` is the version initially installed by the Windows installer, and `main` is the development branch.
- `windowsDownload`, `macDownload` and `linuxDownload` are download links for each platform.
- `date` is the date at which the version was published, in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.
- `changelog` is the changelog of the version, pulled straight from the `changelog.txt` file on the repository. (That's where in-app update changelogs come from.)
